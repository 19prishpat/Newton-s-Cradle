# Matter.js Pendulum Simulation

## Overview

This project is a pendulum simulation using the Matter.js physics engine. It demonstrates the use of chains and bodies in a simple pendulum setup, where multiple pendulums are suspended from a single point and can be interacted with using force.

## Features

- **Pendulum Simulation**: A series of pendulums connected by chains to a fixed floor.
- **Interactive**: Apply force to the first pendulum using the UP_ARROW key to see the effect.
- **Physics Engine**: Utilizes Matter.js for physics simulation.
